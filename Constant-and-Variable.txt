// Declaring a constant
let placeOfBirth = "New Jersey"

// Declaring a variable
var currentLocation = "New Jersey"

//:  Once you've declared a variable, you can assign a new value to it:
// Assigning a new value to a variable
currentLocation = "California"

//:  - Experiment: Below, add a line of code that assigns a new value to `currentLocation`:
// Assign a new value
currentLocation = "San Bernadino"

var score = 0
//: If the player scores ten points, you can update the score:
score = 10
//: Now the player scores another five points, so you can update the score again:
score = 15
//: This is nice, but it would be nicer to use the existing value of `score` when calculating the new value. To add another five points, you can do this:
score = score + 5
/*:
It might seem strangely circular to set a value to equal itself plus something else, as if you're both setting a value and changing it in a single step, but that isn't exactly what's happening. Even though itâ€™s a single line of code, Swift evaluates the statement in two different steps.

The right side of the assignment is calculated first, as if it were written on its own in a playground. However, just doing a calculation with a variable doesn't change its value:
 */
score + 5
score
score + 3
score
//: But when a calculation is on the right side of an assignment, the variable stores the calculation's result and takes on a brand new value:
score = score + 5
score = score + 3
score = score + score
