//1. The ants behavior was pretty speratic if the pheromones evaporated qick. I noticed that the ants decided to follow the food pheromones more than the other ones.
//2. I found that lower pheromone evaporation and higher home and food pheromones deposite reate creates more productive ants, and a steady speed produced a more organized colony.
//3. If the environment cell size was altered by 10 to 15 there was a large visible change in the simulation
//4. The peramiteres are related in a way that if you decrese any value decrease the rest of the numbers in the simulation by the same pecentage of the said value decreased.
//5. The most sucessful foraging behaviors were ones with a fairly high ant population and high food and home pheromone deposite rate.
//6. If i wanted to make this model more real world i would add preditors like, grasshopers, roach, ant-eaters etc.
//7. None
